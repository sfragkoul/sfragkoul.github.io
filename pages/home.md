Hey there, my name is Stella! 
    
I began my academic journey with a B.Sc. in **Physics** 🪐 followed by an M.Sc. in **Digital Media and Computational Intelligence** 👩‍💻. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in **Bioinformatics** 🧬 and also working as a **research fellow** 👩‍🔬. 

My research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including applications of artificial intelligence in various domains, variant calling methods for detecting genetic lesions, mathematical modeling of biological systems and the generation of synthetic biomedical data.

Hey there, my name is Stella! 
    
I began my academic journey in **Physics** 🪐 in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki from which I graduated in 2019 and in 2021 got my MSc in **Digital Media and Computational Intelligence** 👩‍💻.
    
I am currently pursuing a PhD in **Bioinformatics** 🧬 in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) and also working as a research fellow at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) in the Center for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH). 
    
I am also keen on photography, plants and I have two cats named Milko & Mo :)

I am a proud member of the [Biodata Analysis Group](https://biodataanalysisgroup.github.io/) (aka Bioinformatics Lab)!

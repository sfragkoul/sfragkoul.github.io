Oh hello there, my name is Stella, nice to meet you! I enjoy exploring new things, taking long walks in nature and preparing flavoursome meals! I am also a D&D adventurer! üé≤üêâüè∞üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


My journey: **Physics** B.Sc.ü™ê > **Machine Learning** M.Sc.üë©‚Äçüíª > **Bioinformatics** Ph.D.üß¨

My research interests include:
- generation methods of **synthetic biomedical data**,
- **variant calling** methods for detecting genetic lesions, 
- applications of **machine learning** in various domains, 
- **mathematical modeling** of biological systems.

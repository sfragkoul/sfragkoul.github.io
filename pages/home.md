Hi, I’m Stella — welcome! 👋  
I’m a physicist-turned-bioinformatician who loves blending science with creativity.  
I enjoy exploring new things, taking long walks in nature, and preparing flavoursome meals. I’m also a D&D adventurer! 🎲🐉🏰🧙🏻‍♂️

### 🧭 My academic path  
From exploring the universe with **Physics (B.Sc.)** 🪐  
to diving into **Computational Intelligence (M.Sc.)** 👩‍💻  
now navigating genomes in **Bioinformatics (Ph.D.)** 🧬

---

### 🔬 What I work on

I'm currently a PhD candidate in **Bioinformatics**, working on problems at the intersection of biology, data, and computation.

My research interests include:
- 🧠 **Machine learning** – especially methods for biological data.
- 🧪 **Synthetic data** – creating artificial datasets to evaluate algorithms.
- 🧬 **Variant calling** – detecting genetic variants from sequencing data.
- 📊 **Modeling** – building interpretable and reliable computational models.

I am currently a PhD candidate at the Biology department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) and also work as a research assistant at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) in the Center for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) under the supervision of Dr. Fotis Psomopoulos. I obtained my BSc in Physics in 2019 and MSc in Digital Media and Computational Intelligence in 2021, both from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh). 
My research interests include machine and deep learning, bioinformatics and somatic variant calling.

I am a proud member of the [Biodata Analysis Group](https://biodataanalysisgroup.github.io/) (also known as the Bioinformatics Lab at the [Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB / CERTH)](https://inab.certh.gr/))! Any resemblance with their page is because I borrowed their code for inspiration :P

Hey there, my name is Stella! 
    
I began my academic journey in the Physics ⚛️ department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki from which I graduated in 2019 and in 2021 got my MSc in Digital Media and Computational Intelligence 👩‍💻 from the department of Informatics. 
    
I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Biology 🔬 department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) and also working as a research assistant at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) in the Center for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) under the supervision of Dr. Fotis Psomopoulos. 
    
My current research interests include Machine and Deep Learning, Bioinformatics and Cancer Genomics 🧬.
    
I have also collaborated with the Virgo group at AUTh in the field of Gravitational-wave Astronomy 🪐. 
    
I am also keen on photography 📷, plants 🎍 and I have two cats named Milko & Mo 🐈 :)

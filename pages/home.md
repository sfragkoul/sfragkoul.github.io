<div align="justify"> Hey there, my name is Stella! I began my studies at the Physics department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki from which I graduated in 2019 and in 2021 got my MSc in Digital Media and Computational Intelligence from the department of Informatics. I am currently a PhD candidate at the Biology department of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (UoA) and also work as a research assistant at the Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB) in the Center for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH) under the supervision of Dr. Fotis Psomopoulos. My current research interests include Machine and Deep Learning, Bioinformatics and Somatic Variant Calling but I have also collaborated with the Virgo group at AUTh in the field of Gravitational Astronomy. I am also keen on landscape and nightscape photography :) </div>

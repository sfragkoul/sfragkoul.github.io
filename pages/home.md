Hey there, my name is Stella! 
    
I began my academic journey with a B.Sc. in **Physics** 🪐 followed by an M.Sc. in **Digital Media and Computational Intelligence** 👩‍💻. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in **Bioinformatics** 🧬 and also working as a **research fellow** 👩‍🔬. 

My research interests encompass a wide range of topics, including:
- applications of machine learning in various domains, 
- variant calling methods for detecting genetic lesions, 
- mathematical modeling of biological systems and 
- the generation of synthetic biomedical in-silico data.

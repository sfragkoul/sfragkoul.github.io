Hey there, my name is Stella! 

I enjoy learning new things, taking long walks in nature and preparing interesting meals! I am also a huge D&D fan! 🎲🐉🏰🧙🏻‍♂️


My journey: **Physics** B.Sc.🪐 > **Machine Learning** M.Sc.👩‍💻 > **Bioinformatics** 🧬Ph.D.

My research interests include:
- generation methods of **synthetic biomedical data**,
- **variant calling** methods for detecting genetic lesions, 
- applications of **machine learning** in various domains, 
- **mathematical modeling** of biological systems.

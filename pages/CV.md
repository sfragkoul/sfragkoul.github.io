- 07/2022-present, 	**PhD Student**, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece

   Duties: Design and development of bioinformatics algorithms focused on the deconvolution and disambiguation of low-frequency somatic variants in human DNA through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. Additionally, employed synthetic data generation techniques and mathematical modeling to simulate and analyze biological processes, to achieve valuable insights of the behavior of biological systems.

### TEACHING
<p style="margin-bottom:15px"></p>

- 22/01/2024 - 26/01/2024 	**Exploratory analysis of biological data: data carpentry**, EMBL Advanced Training Centre, Heidelberg and Virtual

     Helper duties for this hands-on workshop about teaching researchers the fundamental data skills they need to conduct their work and providing high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. The domain-specific approach allows participants to tailor the data, content, and tools to reflect the specific data and analysis needs of different areas. [EMBL Course Page](https://www.embl.org/about/info/course-and-conference-office/events/dtc24-01/#vf-tabs__section-speakers)


- 28/11/2022 - 1/12/2022 	**WES / WGS data analysis**, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering (IMGGE), Belgrade, Serbia

   A training workshop in Bioinformatics which focused on germline small variant calling, larger variant calling – CNV pipeline, Genome Wide Association Studies and Common Workflow Language and Docker. The pipeline which I taught was that of somatic copy number variation calling using the [CNVkit](https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). [Course Materials](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/IMGGE-WES-WGS-data-analysis-workshop)


- 03/2021 	**Introduction to Python**, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Virtual Event

   A crash course, taught voluntarily, which consisted of six teaching hours, for 4th year students, at the Physics Department, who attended *“Numerical Analysis”* taught by [Nikolaos Stergioulas](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=AXlRP8EAAAAJ&hl=el).

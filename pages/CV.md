#### Workshops and classes 

- 19/05/2025 - 23/05/2025 	**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Life Sciences**, Aussois, Savoie (73), France

  Learners will be guided across the various steps in Machine Learning, from the foundational concepts, through the deep learning and generative AI techniques, closely complemented by insights into the existing reporting (DOME Recommendations) and regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act). This week-long training will bring together experts from four ELIXIR Nodes and deliver a hands-on, high-intensity course available for members from all ELIXIR Nodes. For more details visit [here](https://moodle.france-bioinformatique.fr/course/view.php?id=34).

- 22/01/2024 - 26/01/2024 	**Exploratory analysis of biological data: data carpentry**, EMBL Advanced Training Centre, Heidelberg and Virtual

     Helper duties for this hands-on workshop about teaching researchers the fundamental data skills they need to conduct their work and providing high-quality, domain-specific training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. The domain-specific approach allows participants to tailor the data, content, and tools to reflect the specific data and analysis needs of different areas.

   A training workshop in Bioinformatics which focused on germline small variant calling, larger variant calling – CNV pipeline, Genome Wide Association Studies and Common Workflow Language and Docker. The pipeline which I taught was that of somatic copy number variation calling using the [CNVkit](https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). [Course Materials](https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/IMGGE-WES-WGS-data-analysis-workshop)


- 03/2021 	**Introduction to Python**, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Virtual Event

   A crash course, taught voluntarily, which consisted of six teaching hours, for 4th year students, at the Physics Department, who attended *“Numerical Analysis”* taught by [Nikolaos Stergioulas](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=AXlRP8EAAAAJ&hl=el). [Course Materials](https://github.com/sfragkoul/Python_Intro)
